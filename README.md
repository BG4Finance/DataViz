# DataViz

In this project "Data Visualization Portfolio" asked by teacher Peter Gruber, at Universit√†
della Svizzera italiana, we have been asked to gather several visualisation of different
data from different sources through any kind of software, programming language, package or
module available.

### Quickest way to test code?
Clone/Download this repository on your computer so you will be provided of all the code and source files you need to smoothly test them! In particular this will ease the deployment of the interactive Shiny App.

## First Challenge
### Good Data, Bad Visual
We must spot a bad data visualisation and make a better version out of it.
For my case I choose to fix a bad visualization,you can find it  in the "GDP% vs.
Consumption" folder. The Bad and the Good graph have being uploaded there with the code I used to create the new graph.

## Second Challenge
### Interactive Visualization, About Myself
An interactive data visualization about my accademic performance measured each semester. Moreover I splitted the exam and computed each average of 4 minors:
Economics, subjects related to teorethical aspects of the economy, such as Macro/Micro-economics,Law, Monetary Economics, Business Political and Organizational Economics.
Finance, here I gathered quantitative and applied financial matters.
Informatics, programming and machine learning classes
Science, maths and statistics.

I had a couple of main issues with this visualisation challenge, in particular I couldn't not scale the bar chart for a clear minor comparison and
```r
conditionalPanel(condition = "input.type == 'uni",
                 radioButtons("course","University Course",
                              c("All"="all", "Bachelor"="bac", "Master"="msc"),
                              selected = "all"))
```
