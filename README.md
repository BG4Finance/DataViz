# DataViz

In this project "Data Visualization Portfolio" asked by teacher Peter Gruber, at Universit√† 
della Svizzera italiana, we have been asked to gather several visualisation of different 
data from different sources through any kind of software, programming language, package or 
module available.

## First Challenge
### Good Data, Bad Visual
We must spot a bad data visualisation and make a better version out of it
