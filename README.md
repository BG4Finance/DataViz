# DataViz

In this project "Data Visualization Portfolio" asked by teacher Peter Gruber, at Universit√†
della Svizzera italiana, we have been asked to gather several visualisation of different
data from different sources through any kind of software, programming language, package or
module available.

### Quickest way to test code?
Clone/Download this repository on your computer so you will be provided of all the code and source files you need to smoothly test them!

## First Challenge
### Good Data, Bad Visual
We must spot a bad data visualisation and make a better version out of it.
For my case I choose to fix a bad visualization,you can find it  in the "GDP% vs.
Consumption" folder. The Bad and the Good graph have being uploaded there with the code I
used to create the new graph.

## Second Challenge
### Interactive Visualization, About Myself
